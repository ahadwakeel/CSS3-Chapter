    <div class="d">  @font-face allows you to use a font, even if it is not installed on the computer of the person  browsing, by allowing
           you to specify a path to a copy of the font,it is not on the user's machine.
           Because this technique allows a version of the font to be
           downloaded to the user's computer, it is important that the license for the font permits it to
           be used in this way. </div>
